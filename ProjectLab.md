# Swift App

# Introduction
Skincare feels like a never-ending experiment with a complicated cycle of trial and error. It is well known that skin is an indicator, by monitoring which we can prevent various serious deceases.
Unfortunately, currently skin problems have no commonly used detection and solution algorithm. However, technological progress provides us with computational resources, which are widespread and powerful and can help us to make a huge step towards the solution of the skincare problem and make the detection of skin issues available from home for everyone.
The goal of the Project Laboratory is to build a neural network for image processing, that will detect skin problems. Since one of the most visible and wide-spread skin problem is acne, it can become the first skin problem that will be detected by the neural network.
In the frames of this Project, the students were  engaged in developing a mobile face care application that will help users to track the state of their skin.

# Architecture description

### Log in

 The `Google Firebase` was used to implement login and registration functionality. All the users and their encrypted passwords are stored in the `firebase` database

### Design

First of all SWIFT UIKit was chosen to build the user interface, however, after the thorough investigation design of the project was implemented using the SwiftUI library.

### Server communication 

Local Python server (https://github.com/AirinB/SkinTrackingApp )is supposed to be run to let the application work. When user uploads the photo it is initially uploaded to the `Firebse` storage and download link is is sent to the locally running server via the `POST HTTP` request. Server is downloading the image, processes it (it contains AI model trained to detect pimples), uploads to the `Firebase` and sends the processed image download link as a response. After this, the response link is saved to UserDefault. When user clicks to the "box" icon on the navigation bar, processed image is retrieved and shown to him/her. Image is saved to the local storage later, and added to the list of the last user analysis.


### News API

News API was chosen for the implementation of the beauty news feed. The MVVP pattern is used to implement it: View contains ViewModel and ViewModel contains the NewsService, which fires the events when the API call is done. Based on these events ViewModel updates the view.

## Run for development

1. `git clone https://github.com/danilashtefan/SkinCareClient.git` 
2. in the main folder `pod install`
3. run the project using Xcode simulator

# Server

## Inspiration
Skin is the human body's largest organ, which requires constant control and supervision. It is well known that skin is an indicator of peopleâ€™s health, so by monitoring its condition various serious diseases can be prevented. Unfortunately, currently skin problems have no commonly used detection and solution algorithm. However, technological progress provides us with computational resources, which are widespread and powerful and can help us to make a huge step towards the solution of the skincare problem and make the detection of skin issues available from home for everyone.

## SkinTracking API
Skin tracking API is working on top of the `object detection` model that we trained with publicly available data. I receives a POST request and sends the data to the processing model which detects acne on the photo and sends as a result the link from where the processed image can be downloaded.

### Sample request in Python 


```python
        data={'url': 'https://sampleurl/image.jpg '}
        x = requests.post(server_url, data=my_obj)
        print(x.content)
```


### Sample responce

```python
{
'processed_image_url:  'https://sampleprocessedimageurl/image.jpg'
}
```

## How we built it
### Server
For the server we used a Python micro web framework `flask`, that made the communication through Http very easy. For the uploading of the processed images we used `firebase`. The processing itself is done by the processing service which is with the model that we trained using the `object-detection` library build on top of `tensorflow`.


### Model
We created 2 versions for the processed model. The first one did not satisfy the requirements because it had very bad accuracy. So we researched how we could imporove the model and we tried the following tecqniques:

- More data
- Much more accurate labling of the skin issues
- Augmenting the data that we collected

**For both models we followed the following steps**

#### Collecting data
Unfortunately there are not public datasets collected for the acne, so we surfed the internet in order to collect all the dataset. It is important to have a diverse dataset in order to not have a biased model. Especially when identifiing skin issues such as acne is very important to handle different nationalities, skin color and different forms of acne such as whiteheads, blackheads, papules, pustules, nodule and other. Since we are limited in the data the model might be not very accurate for the following reasons.  


#### Labeling
Because this is a classification problem it is required to label images, `labelImg` is a python based tool that was used for this purpose. It generates a corresponding  *.xml file which is used then by the object-detection

#### Training the model

As the first step in training the model, a TensorFlow XML-to-TFRecord converter was used in order to transform the *.xml to *.records. 
Secondly, the SSD ResNet50 V1 FPN 640x640 model from the TensorFlow 2 Detection Model Zoo was used to provide the neural network the ability to detect custom objects. Several parameters were edited in the pipeline.config file so that it would use the appropriate training data and some minor details, such as metrics and batch size, were changed. From the object-detection repository the model_main_tf2.py was incorporated into the project and ran as a training job. This model was run on several computers with different RAM and with/without GPU. In total every training cycle took from 5h to 12h. Tensor board, demonstrated in the following figure allowed to monitor the process.
